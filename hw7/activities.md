# Q1

## Using Chrome...

Using Chrome we see that, after erasing the cache from the CRLs, we make a HTTP request to the OCSP server, which responds in time with the proper OCSP response: whether or not the certificate is valid.

Example from our Wireshark export:

```wireshark
Request:

554	10.973334	10.0.0.156	72.21.91.29	HTTP	417	GET /ME8wTTBLMEkwRzAHBgUrDgMCGgQUdLTnIxnHZZIVQER7x84%2BkMIYdusEFKSN5b58eeRwI20uKTStI1jc... HTTP/1.1

Response:

562	11.031332	72.21.91.29	10.0.0.156	OCSP	753	Response [Which encodes Revoked in the OCSP certStatus]
```

## Using Firefox...

We also see an OCSP request being made.

The Firefox OCSP seems to be more clear. It is very easy to replicate, even on a non-vm where there is lots of noise. Since normal calls do not usually make OCSP calls, starting wireshark before making a request in Firefox, and immediately stopping wireshark provides a relatively easy search in wireshark for the OCSP requests.

An interesting difference between Firefox and Chrome though: Chrome did not make any OCSP-protocol Requests. Rather, it was making OCSP requests through what appeared to be an HTTP abstraction layer.

## Using Safari...

I couldn't get this working with safari, safari, even for a revoked website made an OCSP call that returned with the GOOD status.

## Using openssl...

One can re-create curl, such that it always calls checks the CRLs for a given site (currently curl does not). This might lead to security concerns.

For example

```
# curl https://revoked.badssl.com/
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <link rel="shortcut icon" href="/icons/favicon-red.ico"/>
  <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/icons/icon-red.png"/>
  <title>revoked.badssl.com</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css">
  <style>body { background: red; }</style>
</head>
<body>
<div id="content">
  <h1 style="font-size: 10vw;">
    revoked.<br>badssl.com
  </h1>
</div>

<div id="footer">
  The leaf certificate for this site has been revoked.
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

But this actually has a revoked certificate, which openssl does not check. [./scurl](./scurl.sh) attempts to fix this.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

openssl s_client -servername $1 -connect $2:443 < /dev/null 2>&1 |  sed -n '/-----BEGIN/,/-----END/p' > ./certificate.pem

mkdir ./.scurl_tmp

openssl s_client -showcerts -servername $1 -connect $2:443 < /dev/null 2>&1 |  sed -n '/-----BEGIN/,/-----END/p' > ./.scurl_tmp/certs.txt

python3 ./build_chain.py ./.scurl_tmp/certs.txt ./chain.pem

OSCP_URL=$(openssl x509 -noout -ocsp_uri -in ./certificate.pem)

openssl ocsp -issuer chain.pem -cert certificate.pem -text -url $OSCP_URL
```

Try running:

```
./scurl.sh revoked.badssl.com www.revoked.badssl.com
```

Or any command where the first argument is the servername and the second argument is the url you are connecting to. We need the server, because in order to get all the information we need to allow for SNI (Server Name Indication).

We see using this new scurl tool:

```
./scurl.sh revoked.badssl.com www.revoked.badssl.com
mkdir: ./.scurl_tmp: File exists

That we can make the OCSP request and received a response indicating that the certificate has been revoked, and then not proceed with the connection.

# Q2 Suppression

I suppressed traffic using the `pf.config` file on MacOSX. AFter determining the IP for digicerts OCSP server, I suppresed that IP address using:

```
block drop from any to 142.251.32.35
```

If we suppress traffic to Digicerts ocsp verification url, then obviously we cannot verify the status of a certificate.

Our `scurl` applications stops working, as notable here:

```
mkdir: ./.scurl_tmp: File exists
OCSP Request Data:
    Version: 1 (0x0)
    Requestor List:
        Certificate ID:
          Hash Algorithm: sha1

          Issuer Key Hash: 5168FF90AF0207753CCCD9656462A212B859723B
          Serial Number: 0E32CC48D16B1507813C2302D351BE89
    Request Extensions:
        OCSP Nonce:
            04101AB6FAA34EFF5D4D7FC67036A45546CC
```

It makes the request, but stalls on trying to get a response, and ultimately times out.

Chrome on the other hand continues as if the certificate were verified (or somehow knows that the certificate is NOT valid) Chrome could be doing this through caching.

This seems to also happen in firefox and in safari. Though I am not entirely sure what mechanism they each use.

After a bit of investigation, it appears that in addition to the OCSP url in the `Certificate Authority Information Access` extension for the x509 standard, there is another method for verifying a certificate information. That is a `.crt` file. Turns out this is the certificate file for the signer. So verifying the signer is another option.

It is also possible that the browser is using the CRL distribution points (which is also an extension in the x509 standard), or checking against the CRLs that are stored locally in the browser.

> We know from some research that Chrome uses CRLsets that are stored on the browser.
